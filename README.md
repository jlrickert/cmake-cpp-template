# cpp-template

  1. Prerequisites
  2. Building

# 1. PREREQUISITES

This project requires:
  - Cross-platform Make (CMake) v2.8.8+
  - GNU Make or equivalent.
  - G++ or an alternative, reasonably conformant C++ compiler.

# 2. BUILDING

This project uses the Cross-platform Make (CMake) build system. However, a
configure script and Makefile are conveniently provided so that
the typical build invocation of "./configure" followed by "make" will work.
For a list of all possible build targets, use the command "make help".

NOTE: Users of CMake may believe that the top-level Makefile has been
generated by CMake; it hasn't, so please do not delete that file.
